# Regression Analysis 

This project demonstrates core regression techniques using Python.  
It was completed as part of **CS577: Principles and Techniques of Data Science** and highlights my ability to apply data science methods to real-world problems.  

The project encompasses simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, and polynomial regression, all implemented using Python, pandas, scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.

## Features

- **Simple Linear Regression**  
  Predicts salary based on years of experience.  
  Evaluates model performance using R² and RMSE.  

- **Multiple Linear Regression**  
  Predicts company profit based on R&D spend, administration, marketing, and state (with categorical encoding).  
  Provides a visual comparison of actual vs. predicted profit.  

- **Polynomial Regression**  
  Fits non-linear data with polynomial features.  
  Compares baseline linear regression against polynomial regression for more complex datasets.

## Why This Project
I created this project to strengthen my understanding of regression models in data science. It reflects real-world analysis tasks and highlights my ability to:  
- Apply regression techniques (linear, multiple, polynomial)  
- Clean and prepare datasets for analysis  
- Evaluate models with statistical metrics  
- Automate data visualizations for reporting
